            <p>
              We understand and respect that your privacy is important to you.
              We use and share personal information that you provide only in
              ways that we tell you about. We secure personal information that
              you provide us to prevent it from being used and shared for other
              purposes. For more details, please read our Internet Privacy
              Policy below or contact us. Respect for the privacy of personal
              information about you is very important to us. Blue Sky Marketing
              is committed to collecting, maintaining, and securing personal
              information about you in accordance with this policy, as well as
              applicable laws, rules and regulations. This policy applies to
              personal information (as defined below) collected from Blue Sky
              Marketing resources and communications (such as Web sites, e-mail,
              and other tools) that display a link to this policy. This policy
              does not apply to personal information collected from offline
              resources and communications, except in cases where such personal
              information is consolidated with personal information collected by
              Blue Sky Marketing . This policy also does not apply to
              third-party resources to which Blue Sky Marketing Web sites may
              link, where Blue Sky Marketing does not control the content or the
              privacy practices of such resources. Please read this policy
              carefully. Should you have any questions about this policy or our
              data collection, use and disclosure practices, please contact us
              at the address listed on this site in the section 'Contact Us'.
              The term "personal information" as used throughout this policy,
              applies to any information or set of information that identifies
              or that is used by or on behalf of Blue Sky Marketing to identify
              an individual.
            </p>
            <h2>How do we collect personal information?</h2>

            <p>
              Blue Sky Marketing collects personal information through Web sites
              and other resources. Blue Sky Marketing also offers resources in
              collaboration with other service providers, from which Blue Sky
              Marketing may receive personal information about users of such
              resources. These collaborations are governed by contracts that
              require personal information to be protected appropriately.
              Individuals may access many parts of our Web sites without
              disclosing any personal information.
            </p>

            <h2>
              There are two methods that are used to collect personal
              information :
            </h2>

            <ul>
              <li>
                Information that you provide: Blue Sky Marketing collects
                personal information and other data that you may enter into
                forms or data fields on our Web sites. Such information may
                include, but not be limited to, contact information (such as
                your name, postal address, e-mail address, telephone number,
                user ID and password), date of birth, professional credentials,
                hobbies and interests. Blue Sky Marketing may also collect
                health information about you that you provide by responding to
                our questions and surveys.
              </li>
              <li>
                Information collected from your computer or other electronic
                device: Some of our Web sites and other resources use tracking
                technologies, such as cookies, to provide additional
                functionality that enables you to use these resources more
                effectively. Blue Sky Marketing uses tracking technologies in
                ways that do not identify you personally, such as to track
                accurately numbers of users or referring sites to our resources.
                In some cases, Blue Sky Marketing may use tracking technologies
                in ways that identify you personally, but only after you have
                entered personal information into a form or data field on our
                Web sites, or where we have registered you to use our resources
                by providing a user ID and password based on information
                validated through other offline interactions with you. We may
                use tracking technologies to remember your personal preferences
                and selections, such as personal information that you have
                entered into data fields on our Web sites, answers that you have
                provided in response to our surveys, or sections of our Web
                sites that you visit frequently. You may choose whether or not
                you want Blue Sky Marketing to use tracking technologies to
                remember you, and/or to provide additional personalized services
                to you. If you want to limit data collection through tracking
                technologies, please refer to your choices as described below.
                Some of our Web sites and other resources use tracking
                technologies, such as cookies, to provide additional

            <h2>What are cookies?</h2>
            <p>
              A cookie is a small data file that is sent by Web servers to your
              computer's hard drive, where your Internet browser files are kept.
              Cookies enable Web sites to store small bits of information on
              your computer and retrieve that information at a later time. Blue
              Sky Marketing uses two types of cookies: session cookies, which
              are temporary cookies that are erased from your computer's memory
              when you close your Internet browser or turn your computer off,
              and persistent cookies, which exist on your computer's hard drive
              until they expire, unless you delete them at an earlier time.
            </p>

            <h2>Why do you collect, use and disclose personal information?</h2>
            <p>
              Blue Sky Marketing collects personal information as necessary to
              enable individuals to register for, customize and personalize
              certain of Blue Sky Marketing resources and communications. Blue
              Sky Marketing uses personal information collected to provide
              products, services and features that individuals have requested;
              for example, educational literature and related information about
              Blue Sky Marketing products, e-mail programs, tools, quizzes,
              questionnaires, and surveys. Blue Sky Marketing analyzes personal
              information collected to identify and offer additional services
              and promotions that we believe you might find interesting. Blue
              Sky Marketing evaluates use of some resources and communications
              with non-identifiable information only. Blue Sky Marketing also
              may use personal information to audit its resources for authorized
              access and security.
            </p>
            <h2>Does this site consolidate personal information?</h2>
            <p>
              Consistent with the purposes identified and standards set within
              this policy and other applicable privacy notices that have been
              provided, in some cases Blue Sky Marketing consolidates and uses
              personal information that individuals share with Blue Sky
              Marketing through various services and channels, such as the
              telephone, surveys, Web sites and other resources and
              communications, in order to enhance the quality of services that
              we offer.
            </p>
            <h2>
              What choices do I have about how this site collects, uses and
              discloses personal information about me?
            </h2>
            <p>You have three categories of choices. These include:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                No personal information collection: You may choose not to
                provide any personal information to Blue Sky Marketing by
                electing not to enter any personal information into a form or
                data field on our Web sites, and by not using any personalized
                services provided by our resources. However, some of our
                resources are available only to individuals who provide personal
                information or who use personalized services.
              </li>
              <li>
                Limitations and options regarding uses and disclosures for other

                remember your personal preferences and selections, enable you to
                choose whether you want Blue Sky Marketing to use such

            <p>
              Personal information about you will be accessible to Blue Sky
              Marketing , including its subsidiaries, divisions and groups

              information solely for and at the direction of Blue Sky Marketing
              . Uses and disclosures of personal information by external
              individuals and organizations acting on Blue Sky Marketing behalf
              are governed by contracts that require personal information to be
              protected appropriately. Personal information about you only will
              be used and disclosed by Blue Sky Marketing and individuals and
              organizations working on its behalf, in a manner consistent with
              this policy, other applicable privacy notices, and as explicitly
              permitted or required by applicable laws, rules and regulations.
            </p>
            <h2>Is my personal information shared with third parties?</h2>
            <p>
              In general, Blue Sky Marketing does not give or sell personal
              information about you to third parties. However, circumstances may
              arise where Blue Sky Marketing may, for business reasons, decide
              to reorganize or divest its business through sale, merger or
              acquisition. In these circumstances, personal information may be
              shared with actual or prospective purchasers. Blue Sky Marketing
              will obtain written assurances that personal information will be
              protected appropriately in these circumstances. Except where
              explicitly permitted or required by law, or provided in this
              policy, personal information about you will not otherwise be
              shared without your permission.
            </p>

            <h2>How is my personal information secured?</h2>
            <p>
              Blue Sky Marketing will take reasonable steps to protect personal
              information as it is transmitted from your computer to our
              resources and servers, as well as to protect personal information
              in its possession from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration
              or destruction. It is your personal responsibility to secure your
              own copies of your passwords and related access codes for our
              resources.

            <h2>How do you protect the privacy of children?</h2>
            <p>

              children and most of the services that we offer are designed for

            <h2>How will I know if this policy is updated?</h2>
            <p>
              Blue Sky Marketing may update this policy periodically. Blue Sky
              Marketing reserves the right to modify, add/or remove portions of
              this privacy statement at its discretion. If we decide to change
              this policy, we will post those changes at this site so you always
              will know what information we gather, how we might use that
              information, and whether we will disclose it to anyone. This
