              Arbitration Agreement And Jury Trial Waiver, Class Action Waiver,
              And Forum Selection Clause.
            </p>

            <p>
              You agree that any and all controversies, disputes, demands,
              counts, claims, or causes of action (including the interpretation
              and scope of this clause, and the arbitrability of the
              controversy, dispute, demand, count, claim, or cause of action)
              between you and Paws To Tail shall exclusively be settled through
              binding and confidential arbitration. Any such arbitration shall
              take place in the state and county where you reside subject to the
              laws of the state of Florida.
            </p>
            <p>
              Arbitration shall be subject to the Federal Arbitration Act and
              not any state or provincial/territorial arbitration law. The
              arbitration shall be conducted before one commercial arbitrator
              with substantial experience in resolving commercial contract
              disputes from a nationally recognized arbitration services such as
              JAMS pursuant to such organization's standard rules and
              procedures. The In the case of arbitration and where permitted by
              law, you are thus agreeing to GIVE UP YOUR RIGHT TO GO TO COURT to
              assert or defend your rights EXCEPT for matters that you file in
              small claims court. Your rights will be determined by a NEUTRAL
              ARBITRATOR and NOT a judge or jury. You are entitled to a FAIR
              HEARING, BUT the arbitration procedures are SIMPLER AND MORE
              LIMITED THAN RULES APPLICABLE IN COURT. Arbitrator decisions are
              as enforceable as any court order and are subject to VERY LIMITED
              REVIEW BY A COURT.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the case of arbitration and where permitted by law, you and
              Paws To Tail must abide by the following rules: (1) ANY CLAIMS
              BROUGHT BY YOU OR PAWS TO TAIL MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTY'S
              INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY
              PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING; (2) THE ARBITRATOR
              MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON'S CLAIMS, MAY NOT
              OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS
              PROCEEDING, AND MAY NOT AWARD CLASS-WIDE RELIEF; (3) in the event
              that you are able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration
              will be prohibitive as compared to costs of litigation, Paws To
              Tail will pay as much of your filing and hearing fees in
              connection with the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary
              to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive as compared
              to the cost of litigation; (4) Paws To Tail also reserves the
              right in its sole and exclusive discretion to assume
              responsibility for all of the costs of the arbitration; (5) the
              arbitrator shall honor claims of privilege and privacy recognized
              at law; (6) the arbitration shall be confidential, and neither you
              nor we may disclose the existence, content or results of any
              arbitration, except as may be required by law or for purposes of
              enforcement of the arbitration award; (7) the arbitrator may award
              any individual relief or individual remedies that are permitted by
              applicable law; and (8) each side pays its own attorneys' fees and
              expenses unless there is a statutory provision that requires the
              prevailing party to be paid its fees and litigation expenses, and,
              in such instance, the fees and costs awarded shall be determined
              by the applicable law.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the event that a party fails to proceed with Arbitration,
              unsuccessfully challenges the Arbitrator's award, or fails to
              comply with the Arbitrator's award, the other party shall be
              entitled to costs of suit, including reasonable attorneys' fees.
